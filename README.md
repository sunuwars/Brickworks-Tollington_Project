# Description
An MVP built for promoting Brickworks, in the Tollington area, London, as a social-action hub for the local community.  Anyone can have life experiences, knowledge, skills which if given an accessible platform can empower people to give, to collaborate, form a social action and help community.

The aim of this app is to empower people to build their community, to give, and to find solutions to their problems.

This is my personal extension to our team project at Founders and Coders, London.
Engaging people to find a solutions to their problems in a platform people would prefer/find easier to engage is a very important first step.
I have implemented social media(twitter) feed on social actions page, which on clicking will take to that tweet in twitter and people can reply, collaborate, form an idea for social action.
The twitter account is my own account created for traialing this app.
